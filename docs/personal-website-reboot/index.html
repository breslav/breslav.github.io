when I began my PhD in 2010 and the last post to it was in 2018. Much of my old content centered around topics I was absorbing in grad school, like probabilistic graphical models, linear algebra, and general computing tools. A lot has happened since then and I hope to blog about some new topics that are on my mind soon, so stay tuned!" />

  <p>It&rsquo;s 2025 and I&rsquo;ve decided it was time to reboot my personal website and blog which had both gone defunct over the years. My old <a href="https://valserb.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> was started
when I began my PhD in 2010 and the last post to it was in 2018. Much of my old content centered around topics I was absorbing in grad school, like probabilistic graphical models, linear algebra, and general computing tools. A lot has happened since then and I hope to blog about some new topics that are on my mind soon, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Also thanks to <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HUGO</a> for enabling me to produce this minimalist personal website with an integrated blog!</p>
