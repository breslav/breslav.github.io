title: Personal Website Reboot 
---

It's 2025 and I've decided it was time to reboot my personal website and blog which had both gone defunct over the years. My old [blog](https://valserb.wordpress.com "") was started
when I began my PhD in 2010 and the last post to it was in 2018. Much of my old content centered around topics I was absorbing in grad school, like probabilistic graphical models, linear algebra, and general computing tools. A lot has happened since then and I hope to blog about some new topics that are on my mind soon, so stay tuned! 

Also thanks to [HUGO](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearblog/ "") for enabling me to produce this minimalist personal website with an integrated blog!
