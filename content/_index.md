Hi everyone! I'm Mikhail and I'm an Applied Scientist who enjoys bringing novel and experimental ideas to life via software development. I am generally interested in machine learning and its application in domains like computer vision, language processing, and autonomous vehicles/robots. 

Currently, I'm a systems engineer at [Cruise](http://www.getcruise.com "") working on validating the safety of autonomous vehicles. Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com "") working on a [code recommendation tool](http://aka.ms/IntelliCodeAPIUsageExamples "").

Before entering industry, I earned my PhD from the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.bu.edu/ "") of [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu ""), where I was a member of the [Image and Video Computing](https://www.bu.edu/cs/research-groups/ivc/ "") group advised by [Dr. Margrit Betke](https://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/betke/ ""). During my PhD, I specialized in Computer Vision and Machine Learning with a particular focus on 2D & 3D pose estimation applied to flying animals. 

I also earned my B.S. & M.S. degrees from the [Department of Electrical Engineering ](https://www.ee.psu.edu "") at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu ""). 

My past research can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gW857EAAAAAJ&hl=en "").

When I'm not working I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring the outdoors through [hiking](https://www.wta.org "").
